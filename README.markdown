eximo
=====
Eximo looks in the trace log for binding errors, and displays them in the application window and on the Taskbar Notification Area. It was written in a great hurry to scratch an itch.

licence
-------
eximo is licensed under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html](GNU Lesser General Public License).

### why the LGPL?
The GPL is specifically designed to reduce the usefulness of GPL-licensed code to closed-source, proprietary software. The BSD license (and similar) don't mandate code-sharing if the BSD-licensed code is modified by licensees. The LGPL achieves the best of both worlds: an LGPL-licensed library can be incorporated within closed-source proprietary code, and yet those using an LGPL-licensed library are required to release source code to that library if they change it.

installation
------------
Ensure you're running the .NET Framework 4.0 or later, then download and run (http://eximo.googlecode.com/files/EximoInstaller.msi).
